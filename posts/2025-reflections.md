Another year has passed already and whilst recovering from a cycling accident, I've had plenty of time to reflect on the past 12 months. I'm breaking this down into a few categories.

## Health & Fitness

First and foremost I'm a keen cyclist and I've not been at my best this year. This is down to an ongoing hip injury caused by overloading my body too much last year and not investing enough in complimentary exercises such as strength training.  

I'm improving on this situation by investing in a personal trainer who will keep me accountable.  I've learned a lot more about my body and how it needs more care now I'm in my 40s. For 2026 I'm aiming to build in better fitness routines and move on from being a one-dimensional athlete.

This year also marks the first year where I haven't felt the need for therapy.  This is the first time in 6 years which I didn't realise until now.  I've been journalling, meditating and trying to be more present in life.

## Career

In January I made the decision to return to The Economist after 18 months at a health care start-up.  I've realised that the pace and stress of that job was no longer for me. It's been a good decision so far and I've found my feet again. I'm lucky to work with very helpful and friendly people and I've been able to gain trust and influence.

One thing I have been conscious of is falling into the trap of chasing titles. I'm working towards becoming a Staff engineer but I know that this will take some time and involve stepping more out of my comfort zone.  I need to move forward with patience and continue with a learning and growth mindset.  I also need to not take on too many things at once!

On the flip side of this, I don't need to put any pressure on myself regarding timescales or even needing to attain this role.  I am grateful for my already privileged position in life.

## Personal Life

I was also back in a relationship again this year, which also ended after 9 months. We left on good terms and I'm grateful for the experience as I was able to see what an emotionally healthy relationship looks like (unlike the last one I had).  

In 2026 I want to continue to learn to love and be comfortable with myself. I still sometimes feel like I should always be doing something or being more productive.

I'm blessed with good friends, neighbours and healthy foundations, so life is there for the taking.  I hope yours is too.
